## Docker Volumes
* refer this https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
* Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
* volumes are completely managed by Docker.
* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
* You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
* Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
* Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
* Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
* New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.
* Volumes on Docker Desktop have much higher performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.

* Create volumes
```
 docker volume create mysql_data
```

* List volumes
```
 docker volume ls
```

* inspect volume 
```

 * Remove a volume:
