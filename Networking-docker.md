## Networking
* refer this https://docs.docker.com/network/

One of the reasons Docker containers and services are so powerful is that you can connect them together,
or connect them to non-Docker workloads. Docker containers and services do not even need to be aware that they are deployed on Docker,
or whether their peers are also Docker workloads or not. Whether your Docker hosts run Linux,
Windows, or a mix of the two, you can use Docker to manage them in a platform-agnostic way.
